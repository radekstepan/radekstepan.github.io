Learn & certify is a two-step process that describes how we progress through our careers. We first need to learn a skill and then convince others of our abilities. Let's discuss the ways one would actually accomplish these steps as a programmer.

Traditionally, one may go to a university. It provides us with learning and towards the end a certification. But, in many countries the cost of attending a university is prohibitive. Many also attack universities for not teaching up to date skills, not understanding the difference between software engineering & programming. Either way, a programmer who intends to stay relevant specializes herself in different languages, approaches, soft skills etc. beyond the 3 or so years spent getting a degree which mostly only jump-starts her career.

As an alternative one may consider various boot-camps. They cover a whole variety of topics ranging from front-end development to data science and everything in between. They cover the learning part of our learn & certify process as well. Primarily these serve people switching careers.


Regardless of the career stage, one may get prolific with social coding approaches such as GitHub or Bitbucket covering the certify end of the spectrum. Many programmers these days present their open source work front and centre. But what if one is working on enterprise or closed-source software in general? In that case, are we to burn midnight oil working after work on open source projects? Sounds a bit like a race to the bottom.

Enter [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/), a company focusing on *certification* also.

> One way to describe it is as a clique of good developers.

Just like with a top university where red bricks by themselves do not generate top graduates, Toptal is being [selective](http://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) in its quest to attract the *best*. What do programmers get after joining Toptal? Well, they become prequalified for remote jobs with companies that recognize their skills and are willing to pay well.

Pretty fun if you think about it. Set the acceptance criteria high, get enough programmers and satisfied companies in and you've got yourself a business. Where's the catch? Well, just like it says on the tin, this site is for programmers only. From Glassdoor reviews we find out that the interview process entails undertaking a Codility algorithm test in addition to a live coding session. This works well if you are a pure programmer. For people of softer-skills persuasion, I hear [Dezigner](http://dezigner.io/) is opening its doors soon.
