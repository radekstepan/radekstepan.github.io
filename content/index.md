# A Senior Front-End Engineer with a specialization in JavaScript (React, AngularJS, Node.js).

I'd call my combination of conceptual and user interface skills *plug & play*. You get code that developers can easily plug into and products that end users can actually play with.

In the past I've helped teams optimize the usability of a design platform, build an e-commerce site, home buyers find their ideal neighbourhood, scientists visualize their data sets or setup a custom PaaS on a machine aptly called "the ukraine"...

Being pragmatic about both the end user experience and the programmer codebase *experience*, I usually work closely with the product owner, the design team and dev team lead on the system at hand. Lastly, I don't limit myself to hands-on coding alone and have been enjoying mentorship/pair-coding and being involved in hiring, getting fellow developers excited about working with me.

A place that I'd be proud to be a part of? Any environment with decisive visionaries where creativity & autonomy is encouraged.

Radek
