# A Front-End Engineer with a specialization in React.js & Flux architecture.

I'd call my combination of conceptual and user interface skills *plug & play*. You get code that developers can easily plug into and products that end users can actually play with.

In the past I've helped teams build an e-commerce site, home buyers find their ideal neighbourhood, scientists visualize their data sets or setup a custom PaaS on a machine aptly called "the ukraine"...

Being pragmatic about both the end user experience and the programmer codebase *experience*, I usually work closely with the product owner, the design team and dev team lead on the system at hand. A place that I'd be proud to be a part of? Any environment with decisive visionaries where creativity & autonomy is encouraged.
